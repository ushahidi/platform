| Register The Auto Loader
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Composer provides a convenient, automatically generated class loader for
| our application. We just need to utilize it! We'll simply require it
| into the script here so that we don't have to worry about manual
| loading any of our classes later on. It feels great to relax.

| Test for gateway check mode
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| If the gwcheck query parameter is present in the query parameters and
| its value is truthy (checks out with TRUE in a loose comparsion), we enter
| gateway check mode. In this mode, the entrypoint returns information about
| the request as received from the web server. An operator or an automated
| tool on the other side can then contrast the responses with expectations,
| in order to determine if the web server and gateway interface are properly
| set up.

| Create The Application

| Run The Application

| the client's browser allowing them to enjoy the creative
| and wonderful application we have prepared for them.
