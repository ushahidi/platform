        Given that I want to make a new "access_token"
        And that the request "Content-Type" header is "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
        And that the request "data" is:
        """

        And that the api_url is ""
        Then I request "oauth/token"
        Then the response is JSON
        And the response has a "access_token" property
        Then the guzzle status code should be 200

    Scenario: Requesting access token with incorrect password fails
