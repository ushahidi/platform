	Scenario: Listing All Posts as GeoJSON
		Given that I want to get all "Posts"
		When I request "/posts/geojson"
		Then the response is JSON
		And the response has a "type" property

		And the "features" property count is "6"
		Then the guzzle status code should be 200

# FIXME:
#   Commenting this while figuring out how to set the cache control level
#   to 'minimal'. This entails changing the Lumen config on the fly, but
#   the approach I have tried hasn't worked out yet.
