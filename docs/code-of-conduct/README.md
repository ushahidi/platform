# Code of Conduct

* [Unacceptable Behaviors](./#unacceptable-behaviors)
* [Where does the Code of Conduct apply?](./#where-does-the-code-of-conduct-apply)
* [What can happen if the CoC is violated?](./#what-can-happen-if-the-coc-is-violated)
* [What to do in case of violations?](./#what-to-do-in-case-of-violations)
* [Guidelines for reporting incidents](./#guidelines-for-reporting-incidents)

Our underlying values that we strive to reflect in everything we do and how we behave are listed [here](values.md).

Like Ushahidi's staff base, Ushahidi's community is incredibly diverse. Ushahidi is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, color, national origin, age, disability \(physical or mental\), sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and political affiliation as well as gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro\(a\)typicality, or physical appearance.

We are constantly evolving this document for the ever-changing world. We strive to become more inclusive in how we support the community, and contributions are very welcome.

We’re grateful for other Code of Conduct pioneers like the [Buffer Code of Conduct](https://open.buffer.com/code-of-conduct/), the [Vox Code of Conduct](http://code-of-conduct.voxmedia.com/?_ga=1.62865454.308680892.1455143920), the [Recurse Center’s Social Rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules), [Write the Docs Code of Conduct](https://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/) and the [Hack Code of Conduct](https://hackcodeofconduct.org/) for their ideas and inspiration.

### Unacceptable Behaviors

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you detect or are the target of any of the following behaviors, please tag us using the **@codeofconduct** tag in the [Platform repository](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform), or email us at **codeofconduct@ushahidi.com.**
{% endhint %}

The Ushahidi team is committed to providing a welcoming and safe environment for all. Discrimination and harassment are expressly prohibited. Furthermore, any behavior or language that is unwelcoming – whether or not it rises to the level of harassment – is also strongly discouraged.

* **No surprise if a contributor isn’t familiar with something**: We believe in the value of [a beginner’s mind](https://open.buffer.com/no-idea/). It’s always acceptable to say “I don’t know” or “I don’t understand.” All questions are great questions! So please don’t act surprised when people aren’t familiar with a tool, person, place or process. 
* **No "well-actually's":** A well-actually happens when someone says something that’s almost – but not entirely – correct, and you say, [“well, actually…”](https://open.buffer.com/customer-service-emails-words/) and give a minor correction.
* **No exclusionary language:** Be careful with the words that you choose, even if it’s as small as choosing “Hey, everyone” over [“Hey, guys”](https://open.buffer.com/diversity-mistakes/). Sexist, racist, ableist, and other exclusionary jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstances. 
* **No subtle -isms:** Much exclusionary behavior takes the form of subtle -isms, or [microaggressions](https://open.buffer.com/inclusive-language-tech/) – things that make others feel unwelcome. For example, saying [“It’s so easy my grandmother could do it”](https://open.buffer.com/diversity-mistakes/) is a subtle -ism with tones of both sexism and ageism.
* **Do not expose people's personal details**: Never share a persons personal details without their consent.
* **No False claims:** Knowingly making harmful false claims about a person is not acceptable.
* No posting sexually explicit or violent material on any of our socials or online platforms.
* No inappropriate disruption during talks.
* Deliberate intimidation, inappropriate physical contact and unwelcome sexual attention will not be tolerated.

## Where does the Code of Conduct apply?

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces, physical and online, managed by Ushahidi. This includes:

* Conferences, meetups, hackathons, workshop and all other events hosted by Ushahidi
* Presentation material used in talks or sessions
* Slack, gitter, intercom and other chat-functions where Ushahidi operates
* Mailinglists
* Github
* Social media
* forum.ushahidi.com

## What to do in case of violations?

If a Code of Conduct incidents happens to you or if you witness it happening to someone else, please contact codeofconduct@ushahidi.com immediately. An email to codeofconduct@ushahidi.com is received by the members of the Code of Conduct working group at Ushahidi who are:

* Romina Suarez
* Cecilia Hinga
* Anna Iosif

In your report, please include, when possible:

* Your contact info, so we can get in touch with you.
* Names or descriptions of anyone who was involved or who witnessed the incident.
* Where and when the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
* Your description of what occured. If there is a writter record \(e.g messages in Gitter, email or conversation-threads in an issue etc\) please include screenshots or a link.
* Any extra context you believe is important for the incident.
* If you believe this incident is ongoing.
* Any other information you believe we should have.

If you don’t have all this information at the time, please still make the report and include as much information as you have.

If you are not sure if the situation was a violation of our Code of Conduct, please still report it. We rather have reports with no action taken than miss an actual violation.

If you feel unsafe reporting in person, you may choose someone to represent you. In this case, we’d need their contact information, but we’d ask you to make clear that this person represents you.

## What can happen if the CoC is violated?

When we receive a report of a violation, we notify the reporter that we have received the report and the Code of Conduct team will meet to review the report. The team may decide on action to take based on the information given, or, if we want more information, we will contact the reporter.

In case of a Code of Conduct violation, the actions we may take are:

* No action \(if the team determines no violation occurred\).
* A private or public warning
* Ensuring that a public apology is made
* Requiring that a participant stops their behaviour
* Requiring that a participant prevents further contact with certain other participants.
* Not publishing the video or slides of a conference talk
* Cancelling a conference talk
* Removing a participant from a conference, meetup or online space, without refund.
* Blocking the person to comment on and open issues or pull-requests in our github-repositories and github-organization.
* Exclude participant from future events.
* Keep records of all participants that have violated the code of conduct.
* Contact law enforcement in case of emergencies\(consent has to be given by the harmed party\)

### **Conflict of interest**

If we believe that there is a conflict of interest, for example, one member of the team was involved in the incident, are friends with, or have any other relationship with the person violating the CoC, that could affect the ability to stay neutral, then this member will not be participating in handling the request.
